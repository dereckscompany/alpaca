# alpaca 0.4.0

## New features

* **Runtime contract enforcement via [roxyassert](https://github.com/dereckscompany/roxyassert).**
  Every `@param` and `@return` across the package is now typed in roxyassert's
  annotation grammar (no prose types remain), and the generated guards are
  wired in: each function and R6 method validates its inputs with
  `assert_args_<fn>()` at entry and its result with `assert_return_<fn>()` (the
  R6 forms `assert_args_<Class>__<method>()` / `assert_return_<Class>__<method>()`).
  Documented contracts and runtime validation now come from one source —
  `R/contracts-generated.R`, regenerated on `document()` like `NAMESPACE`. The
  change adds validation only: no public signature or behaviour changes for any
  valid input. For the sync-or-async methods the return validator is applied to
  the resolved value through `connectcore::then_or_now()`, so it runs in both
  modes (per roxyassert's promise model). `assert` is now an `Imports`
  dependency; `roxyassert` is used at `document()` time only.
* **Typed return shapes for every table-returning method.** The return contract
  of each endpoint method now references a reusable `@type` shape declared in
  `R/types_alpaca.R` (`Bars`, `BarsMulti`, `Trade`/`TradesMulti`,
  `Quote`/`QuotesMulti`, `Snapshot`/`SnapshotMulti`, `Asset`, `Calendar`,
  `Clock`, `CorporateAction`, `News`, `CryptoOrderbook`, `MostActives`,
  `Movers`, `Contract`, `Account`, `AccountConfig`, `Position`, `Activity`,
  `PortfolioHistory`, `Watchlists`/`Watchlist`, `OrderCore`/`Order`, and the
  options `OptionTradesMulti`/`OptionQuotesMulti`), so `assert_return_*` now
  checks the actual columns and their types — not merely "is a `data.table`".
  The list-returning endpoints route their empty branch through typed
  `empty_dt_*()` constructors, so an empty Alpaca response still carries the
  shape's columns. Two shape refinements match Alpaca's wire encoding: the bar
  OHLC / vwap and the trade/quote price columns are `integer | numeric`
  (Alpaca drops the decimal point on a whole-number price, so JSON realises it
  as `integer` for that value), and the `Watchlist` `asset_*` columns are
  nullable (an empty watchlist returns one all-`NA` asset row). Public
  behaviour for any valid response is unchanged.

## Internal

* **Transport migrated onto [connectcore](https://github.com/dereckscompany/connectcore).** The
  Alpaca clients now build on connectcore's shared transport base instead of a
  private copy. `AlpacaBase` inherits `connectcore::RestClient` and customises
  only the two venue-specific seams: `.sign()` adds Alpaca's
  `APCA-API-KEY-ID` / `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` headers (Alpaca authenticates with
  plain API-key headers — no request signing), and `.parse_envelope()` reads
  Alpaca's error shape (204 No Content, `message` / `msg` body fields). Every
  endpoint method still routes through the inherited `private$.request()`
  funnel, so retry, throttle, timeout, and the sync/async branch now come from
  one shared place.
* **Duplicated transport and generic helpers deleted.** The package's own
  `then_or_now()` and the request-funnel internals are gone, replaced by
  `connectcore::build_request()` / `connectcore::then_or_now()`. The generic
  JSON->data.table helpers (`to_snake_case()`, `as_dt_row()`, `as_dt_list()`,
  `collapse_string_array_fields()`) are now imported from connectcore; the
  Alpaca-specific parsers and time coercions are unchanged.
* **Public API, return shapes, and behaviour are unchanged.** `alpaca_build_request()`
  and `alpaca_paginate()` keep their signatures (now thin wrappers over the
  shared funnel), and every existing test continues to pass. The one endpoint
  that relied on `simplifyVector = TRUE` (portfolio history) now coerces the
  parallel arrays itself, preserving `null -> NA` alignment.
* **Request bodies are byte-identical to the pre-migration transport.** Bodies
  are pre-serialised by `alpaca_serialize_body()` (the exact options the old
  `httr2::req_body_json()` funnel used — `auto_unbox = TRUE`, `digits = 22`,
  `null = "null"`) and sent verbatim through connectcore's `body_format = "raw"`
  path, so the wire bytes for orders and every other POST/PUT/PATCH match the
  previous release exactly. The single deliberate departure also fixes a
  long-standing bug: a one-symbol watchlist now serialises `symbols` as a JSON
  array (`["AAPL"]`) instead of a bare scalar (`"AAPL"`), which Alpaca's
  watchlist endpoints require. New tests pin these body bytes.

# alpaca 0.3.0

## Bug fixes

* **`get_bars()` and `get_bars_multi()` now auto-paginate**, returning the full
  `start`..`end` range instead of a single truncated page. Previously both
  issued one request and dropped Alpaca's `next_page_token`, so any request
  whose result exceeded the page size was silently cut off. For
  `get_bars_multi()` this was especially damaging: Alpaca applies the page
  `limit` as a **total row budget across all requested symbols** (filling
  symbols alphabetically), so a single call for 9 symbols × `1Day` × 365 days
  came back as exactly 1,000 rows covering only the first 4 symbols
  alphabetically — the other 5 returned **no data at all**. Surfaced by a
  `tradebot-mini` production cycle that requested a full-year multi-symbol book
  "for 200-period MAs" and unknowingly made decisions on symbols it had zero
  bars for. Both methods now route through `alpaca_paginate()`, following the
  cursor to completion; per-symbol bars split across a page boundary are merged
  back together.

## Features

* **`alpaca_paginate()` gains a `sleep` argument** — seconds to pause between
  page requests (synchronous mode only), to stay under Alpaca's free/Basic
  data-tier rate limit of 200 requests/min. `get_bars()` / `get_bars_multi()`
  expose it (default `0.3`) alongside `max_pages` (default `1000`, a runaway
  guard; pass `Inf` for unbounded).

* **`alpaca_paginate()` warns on truncation rather than silently stopping.** If
  `max_pages` is reached while the server still reports `next_page_token`, the
  pages already fetched are returned (no work discarded) and an `rlang::warn()`
  fires telling the caller to resume from a later `start` or raise `max_pages`.
  This is the deliberate convention over erroring (which would throw away the
  data) or stopping silently (the original bug class).

## Documentation

* **Corrected the `get_bars_multi()` `limit` documentation.** It previously
  claimed `limit` was "max bars per symbol"; it is in fact a per-page total
  across all requested symbols. The new text spells this out and notes that
  auto-pagination returns every symbol's full range regardless of `limit`.

# alpaca 0.2.3

## Bug fixes

* **`AlpacaAccount$get_activities()` and `$get_activities_by_type()` now reject `page_size > 100` at the boundary** with a clear R error instead of letting Alpaca's `HTTP 422: "tried to set the page size to N, but the maximum is 100"` leak through. Surfaced by a downstream production cycle (`tradebot-mini`) that had been silently passing `page_size = 500L` until Alpaca enforced the cap, at which point the obscure vendor 422 was only debuggable by reading server logs. The validation also rejects `NA`, non-scalar, and non-numeric `page_size` with the same clean `rlang::abort()` — otherwise a bare `if (page_size > 100L)` would error with `"missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed"` on `NA` input, undermining the boundary-check itself. Closes [#7](https://github.com/dereckscompany/alpaca/issues/7).

## Documentation

* **`get_activities()` and `get_activities_by_type()` now document Alpaca's id-cursor pagination model.** A new `@section Pagination` block on `get_activities()` walks through the recipe — pass the previous page's last `id` back in as `page_token`, stop when a returned page is shorter than `page_size` — with a worked example. `get_activities_by_type()` cross-references the same section. Automated pagination (replacing `page_size` with `n` / `max_total`) is planned for a follow-up release; the public API will remain backward-compatible.

# alpaca 0.2.2

## Bug fixes

* **`coerce_cols(dt, cols, fn)` deduplicates `cols`**. Previously passing
  the same column name twice — e.g. `coerce_cols(dt, c("created_at",
  "created_at"), rfc3339_to_datetime)` — would re-feed the
  already-coerced POSIXct vector back through `lubridate::as_datetime()`,
  silently producing year-56,000+ values (POSIXct numerics reinterpreted
  as RFC-3339 strings). Now uses `for (col in unique(cols))`, so each
  column is coerced at most once regardless of how callers spell their
  input. Mirrors the kucoin and binance fixes.

* **`rfc3339_to_datetime()` was returning a length-1 `NA_POSIXct_` on
  all-NA input.** When that result flowed through `parse_timestamp_cols()`
  /`coerce_cols()` -> `data.table::set()`, the length-1 POSIXct got
  coerced into the existing column's type (character / numeric / logical)
  rather than replacing the column with a POSIXct one. Endpoints whose
  `@return` blocks documented `POSIXct` could therefore quietly return
  character columns when every upstream row had a missing timestamp.
  Dropped the `all(is.na(x))` short-circuit —
  `lubridate::as_datetime()` already returns a full-length POSIXct
  vector on all-NA input. Mirrors the binance `ms_to_datetime` fix
  caught in binance PR #9 review.

## Refactor

* **New internal `coerce_cols(dt, cols, fn)` helper** in
  `R/helpers_parse.R`. Generalises the existing `parse_timestamp_cols`
  and `parse_date_cols` to any per-column coercion function. Both
  specialised helpers now delegate to `coerce_cols` so there's a
  single core implementation. Same shape and contract as the binance
  package's `coerce_cols`. Internal `@noRd`.

## Tooling

* **`DESCRIPTION` License field** changed from `License: MIT + file LICENSE`
  to `License: MIT`. The previous form required `LICENSE` to be a 2-line
  DCF stub (`YEAR:` / `COPYRIGHT HOLDER:`), but the file carries the
  full MIT text — which is what GitHub's licensee detector wants for
  the MIT badge. The two requirements conflict; dropping `+ file LICENSE`
  lets R CMD check skip the DCF parse of the LICENSE file while leaving
  the GitHub-visible MIT detection intact. Non-CRAN form.

# alpaca 0.2.1

## Bug fixes

* **`collapse_string_array_fields` is now NA-safe.** A scalar
  `NA_character_` input would crash the helper —
  `grepl(";", NA_character_, fixed = TRUE)` returns `NA`, which
  propagates through `any(NA)` and then crashes `if (NA)`. Mixed
  vectors like `c("real", NA)` were also wrong:
  `paste(c("real", NA), collapse = ";")` produced the literal string
  `"real;NA"`, indistinguishable from a genuine `"NA"` value. The
  helper now filters NAs before joining, returns `NA_character_`
  when every element is NA, and uses `na.rm = TRUE` defensively on
  the separator-collision check. Ported from the binance package.

* **`alpaca_backfill_bars()` no longer hides failures on a return
  attribute.** Per-`(symbol, timeframe)` errors are now surfaced as
  `rlang::warn()` warnings during the run, and a final summary
  warning lists the failure count plus affected pairs at the end.
  The previous `attr(combined, "failures")` was easy to miss; the
  return value is now just the data.table with no hidden state.
  Code that read `attr(result, "failures")` should capture warnings
  with `withCallingHandlers()` or `tryCatch()` instead.

# alpaca 0.2.0

## Pure-date fields are now `Date` (breaking)

Fields that carry calendar dates without a time component are now
parsed to `Date` instead of left as `"YYYY-MM-DD"` strings:

- **Corporate actions** (`AlpacaMarketData$get_corporate_actions()`):
  `declaration_date`, `ex_date`, `record_date`, `payable_date`.
- **Options contracts** (`AlpacaOptions$get_contracts()`,
  `$get_contract()`): `expiration_date`, `open_interest_date`,
  `close_price_date`.

`get_corporate_actions()`: the `date_type` argument is now
validated client-side. The accepted values are the suffixed forms
Alpaca's docs and SDKs use — `"declaration_date"`, `"ex_date"`,
`"record_date"`, `"payable_date"` — not the short forms the
roxygen previously documented (`"declaration"`, `"ex"`, ...). The
short forms were not accepted by the server, so any caller relying
on them was already sending an invalid request.

Adds a small shared `parse_date_cols(dt, cols)` helper that walks
candidate column names and parses `"YYYY-MM-DD"` strings to `Date`
in place; columns absent from `dt` are silently skipped.

## Timestamp fields are now POSIXct (breaking)

All RFC-3339 timestamp fields returned by the API are now parsed to
`POSIXct` (UTC) instead of character. Previously some endpoints (bars,
trades, quotes) already did this; the remaining ones did not. Now
covered:

- **Orders** (`AlpacaTrading$get_orders()`, `$get_order()`,
  `$submit_order()`, etc.): `created_at`, `updated_at`,
  `submitted_at`, `filled_at`, `expired_at`, `canceled_at`,
  `failed_at`, `replaced_at`.
- **Account** (`AlpacaAccount$get_account()`): `created_at`.
- **Watchlists** (`$get_watchlists()`, `$get_watchlist()`, etc.):
  `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **Activities** (`$get_activities()`, `$get_activities_by_type()`):
  `transaction_time`.
- **News** (`AlpacaMarketData$get_news()`): `created_at`,
  `updated_at`.
- **Snapshots** (`$get_snapshot()`, `$get_snapshots_multi()`): all
  five nested `*_timestamp` fields. Previously renamed but left as
  character — now parsed consistently with the standalone
  bar/trade/quote endpoints.

Use `lubridate::with_tz()` to view in any other timezone; the
underlying instant is preserved.

## Calendar and clock return parsed datetimes (breaking)

`AlpacaMarketData$get_calendar()` and `$get_clock()` no longer return
character columns for dates and times. Instead:

- `get_calendar()` returns `date`/`settlement_date` as `Date` and
  `open`/`close`/`session_open`/`session_close` as `POSIXct` localised
  to `America/New_York`. Alpaca's `/v2/calendar` reference page does
  not state a timezone explicitly; ET is inferred from `/v2` being
  US-only, the market-data FAQ using NY tz as canonical for bar
  aggregation, and `09:30` only making sense as ET wall-clock. The
  named tz handles DST automatically (a fixed `-05:00` would be wrong
  half the year). See the `AlpacaMarketData` class docs for the full
  reasoning.
- `get_clock()` returns `timestamp`/`next_open`/`next_close` as
  `POSIXct` in `America/New_York`. The wall-clock instant is preserved
  exactly — only the display tz is normalised. Use
  `lubridate::with_tz()` to view elsewhere.

The previous `@return` documentation also omitted `session_open`,
`session_close`, and `settlement_date`; those are now enumerated.

The class-level `AlpacaMarketData` docs now carry a "Timezones"
section spelling out the ET-by-inference assumption for calendar
times (Alpaca does not state it explicitly on the reference page) and
flagging that `/v3` multi-market endpoints will need per-market
timezone lookup. A `TODO(v3)` marker sits next to the
`ALPACA_EXCHANGE_TZ` constant in `R/helpers_parse.R` so a future
migration is hard to miss.

## Internal: date / time helpers chokepoint (developer note)

`R/helpers_parse.R` now carries a top-of-file banner listing the five
date / time helpers (`rfc3339_to_datetime`, `parse_timestamp_cols`,
`parse_date_cols`, `combine_et_datetime`, `hhmm_to_hh_mm`) with a
when-to-use-which guide. The `rfc3339_to_datetime()` roxygen also
explains why it exists as a thin wrapper around `lubridate::as_datetime`
(NULL / all-NA short-circuit, single chokepoint for any future change
of parser). Future contributors should route all RFC-3339 / pure-date
parsing through these helpers rather than calling `lubridate` directly.

## Data-shape convention: one entity = one row

Every method that returns nested API data now follows a single guiding
policy: **identify the entity for the endpoint, and return one row per
entity**. The supporting rules:

1. **Variable-length array of plain strings on a single entity**
   (`conditions`, `attributes`, `permissions`, `symbols`, `image_urls`,
   ...) → collapsed into a single character column joined by `;`. Filter
   with `dt[grepl("X", col)]`. Recover the original vector with
   `strsplit(col[1], ";", fixed = TRUE)[[1]]`.
2. **Variable-length array of objects** (orderbook levels, watchlist
   assets, multi-leg orders, ...) → exploded to long format with
   parent fields replicated and a position-index column added where
   order matters (`level`, `leg_index`, ...).
3. **Fixed-schema nested object** (snapshot bars, account
   configurations, ...) → flattened to wide `parent_child` columns.
4. **Empty / null arrays** → `NA_character_` (not list cells). Empty
   responses → empty `data.table`, not stub rows.

The separator is `;` rather than `,` because semicolons are far less
likely to appear inside any of the values themselves. For fields where a
value could legally contain `;` (URLs in news image fields), the value
is percent-encoded before joining; recover with `URLdecode()` per
element after `strsplit()`.

## REVERSALS (from earlier branch state, not from a released version)

* **Trades** — `get_latest_trade()`, `get_latest_trades_multi()`, and
  `get_trades()` previously exploded the trade-conditions array to long
  format (one row per condition code). They now return **one row per
  trade** with a `;`-joined `conditions` character column. The column
  name moved from `condition` (singular, long-form) to `conditions`
  (plural, collapsed).
* **News** — `get_news()` previously cross-joined `symbols` × `images`
  on each article, producing a cartesian (3 symbols × 6 images = 18
  rows per article). It now returns **one row per article** with
  `symbols`, `image_sizes`, and `image_urls` as `;`-joined character
  columns. The column name moved from `symbol` (singular, long-form)
  to `symbols` (plural, collapsed).

## NEW LIST-COLUMN FIXES

* `get_assets()` / `get_asset()` — `attributes` was a list column; now
  a `;`-joined character (`"fractional_eh_enabled;has_options;..."`).
* `get_latest_quote()` / `get_latest_quotes_multi()` / `get_quotes()` —
  `conditions` was a list column; now `;`-joined character. One quote =
  one row regardless of how many condition codes it carries.
* `get_snapshot()` / `get_snapshots_multi()` — the inner
  `latest_trade_conditions` and `latest_quote_conditions` arrays were
  list columns; now `;`-joined character. Bar `c` close prices stay
  numeric.
* `get_news()` — additionally URL-encodes any literal `;` characters
  inside image URLs before joining (recover via `URLdecode()` per
  element).

## NEW FEATURES

* `get_crypto_orderbook()` (`AlpacaMarketData`) — wraps the
  `/v1beta3/crypto/{loc}/latest/orderbooks` endpoint. Returns a
  long-format `data.table` with `side` (`"bid"` / `"ask"`), `level`,
  `price`, `size`, `timestamp` columns.
* `get_account()` (`AlpacaAccount`) — the nested
  `admin_configurations` and `user_configurations` objects are now
  flattened to wide `parent_child` columns (e.g.
  `admin_configurations_max_options_trading_level`) instead of being
  carried as list columns.

## ORDERS: parent + leg row pattern

`add_order()`, `get_order()`, `get_orders()`, `get_order_by_client_id()`,
`modify_order()` — multi-leg orders (`bracket` / `oco` / `oto`) now
return a flat `data.table` with one row per order, parent and legs
equally:

* `leg_index` (integer) — `NA` on the parent row, `1, 2, ...` on each
  leg in submission order.
* `parent_order_id` (character) — `NA` on the parent row, the parent's
  `id` on each leg row.

Useful filters: `dt[is.na(parent_order_id)]` for "just the parent
orders", `dt[parent_order_id == "<id>"]` for "all legs of one specific
bracket". Simple orders return one row with both helper columns `NA`.

## DOCUMENTATION

* `Verified:` markers bumped to 2026-05-22 on every method affected by
  this PR. Doc-link slugs updated to the post-`/us/` reorg paths where
  they had drifted (`stocksnapshotsingle`, `stocklatesttradesingle-1`,
  `getallorders-1`, etc.).
* `helpers_parse.R` carries a worked round-trip example in the
  `collapse_string_array_fields` docstring for both plain-string and
  URL-encoded fields (`strsplit()` and `URLdecode()` respectively).

## BUG FIXES

* `parse_news` cartesian inflation (3 symbols × 6 images = 18 rows per
  article) is fixed by collapsing both arrays instead of exploding
  both.
* `collapse_string_array_fields()` writes `NA_character_` for empty
  arrays so downstream `rbindlist()` builds a clean character column
  instead of falling back to list when some records have arrays and
  others don't.
* Removed usage of `%||%` operator which was not defined or imported;
  replaced with explicit `if (is.null(...))` checks in
  `helpers_request.R` and `test-bug-hunt.R`.

## TESTS

* 510/510 PASS across mocked unit tests + live integration tests
  against paper trading. New test coverage for: attribute collapse,
  news cartesian fix, percent-encode round trip, snapshot inner
  conditions collapse with bar close-price preservation, bracket-order
  parent/leg shape, no-list-columns assertions on every affected
  method.

## INTERNAL

* `collapse_string_array_fields(x, fields)` — shared helper used by
  `parse_asset`, `parse_news`, `parse_trades`, `parse_quotes`, and
  `parse_snapshot`. Emits a once-per-session `rlang::warn()` if any
  value being collapsed contains a literal `;` (so a future API change
  that admits the separator is loud rather than silent).

# alpaca 0.1.0

## DEPRECATIONS

* `AlpacaAccount$get_portfolio_history()`: the date-range parameters `date_start` / `date_end` are deprecated in favour of `start` / `end`. The old names were silently ignored by the Alpaca API (so any code that "worked" with them was already returning data from the wrong date range). The old argument names are kept as deprecated aliases that forward to `start` / `end` and emit a deprecation warning. They will be removed in a future release.

## COMPATIBILITY NOTES

* This release adds many new optional parameters to existing methods. They are NULL-defaulted, so **named-argument calls are unaffected**.
* For four methods (`get_bars`, `get_bars_multi`, `get_trades`, `get_quotes`) the new params (`asof`, `currency`) are appended at the end of the signature to preserve positional ordering. The same care was taken for `get_option_chain` (`updated_since` now last), `modify_order` (`notional` moved last), and `get_activities` (`category` moved last) so that callers using positional arguments don't break.
* As a general rule, named arguments are the safer idiom in R — code that calls these wrapper methods positionally is fragile against any future addition.

## DOCUMENTATION FIXES

* Repointed every reference link in roxygen comments to the new `https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/…` namespace. 41 of 60 links were 404'ing after Alpaca's docs reorg. All 60 now resolve to HTTP 200.
* Fixed two cases where the new docs slug looked right but pointed at the wrong endpoint:
    - `get_calendar` / `get_clock`: `calendar-2` / `clock-1` now document the new `/v3/` multi-market endpoints; the R wrapper calls `/v2/`. Repointed to `legacycalendar` / `legacyclock` (the US-only `/v2/` docs).
    - `get_assets`-style swaps where Alpaca flipped single-symbol vs multi-symbol slug conventions (e.g. `stockbars` is now the multi endpoint, `stockbarsingle-1` is the single).
* Fixed `Verifieid: → Verified:` typo (62 occurrences across `AlpacaMarketData.R` and `AlpacaOptions.R`).
* Walked every R6 method against its current docs page and bumped `Verified:` markers from `2026-03-10` to `2026-05-21` after diffing params end-to-end.

## NEW FEATURES — API surface expansion

Added support for new optional parameters Alpaca has introduced upstream. All additions are NULL-defaulted, so existing calls are unaffected.

* **Stock historical data** (`get_bars`, `get_bars_multi`, `get_trades`, `get_quotes`): `asof` (symbol-rename handling, e.g. FB → META) and `currency` (ISO 4217). Also documented the expanded `adjustment` enum (`spin-off`, comma-combinable) and `feed` enum (`sip`, `iex`, `otc`, `boats`).
* **Stock latest data** (`get_latest_bar`, `get_latest_trade`, `get_latest_quote`, `get_snapshot`, and their `_multi` variants): `currency`. Expanded `feed` enum to include `delayed_sip` and `overnight`.
* **Market calendar** (`get_calendar`): `date_type` (`"TRADING"` | `"SETTLEMENT"`).
* **Assets** (`get_assets`): `attributes` filter (`ptp_no_exception`, `ptp_with_exception`, `ipo`, `has_options`, `options_late_close`, `fractional_eh_enabled`, `overnight_tradable`, `overnight_halted`).
* **Options contracts** (`get_contracts`): `show_deliverables`, `ppind` (Penny Program Indicator).
* **Options historical data** (`get_option_bars`, `get_option_trades`): `sort`.
* **Options snapshots** (`get_option_snapshots`): `updated_since`, `limit`, `page_token`. (`get_option_chain` also gains `updated_since`.)
* **Orders** (`AlpacaTrading$add_order`): `legs` and `advanced_instructions`. `order_class` enum now accepts `"mleg"` for multi-leg option strategies. `symbol` and `side` are optional when `order_class = "mleg"` (the legs carry that info).
* **Order replace** (`modify_order`): `notional` (for IPO orders) and `advanced_instructions`.
* **List orders** (`get_orders`): `asset_class`, `before_order_id`, `after_order_id`.
* **Account configuration** (`modify_account_config`): `ptp_no_exception_entry`, `disable_overnight_trading`. The `max_options_trading_level` doc now lists the full enum 0–3.
* **Account activities** (`get_activities`): `category` (`"trade_activity"` | `"non_trade_activity"`, mutually exclusive with `activity_types`).

## KNOWN ISSUES / FOLLOW-UPS

* **Corporate actions endpoint deprecated upstream**: `/v2/corporate_actions/announcements` is still functional but Alpaca has flagged it DEPRECATED in favour of `/v1beta1/corporate-actions`. The wrapper still calls the working v2 endpoint. Migration to be tracked separately.
* **`get_option_snapshot` (singular)**: the URL `/v1beta1/options/snapshots/{symbol}` is now the underlying-chain endpoint (see `get_option_chain`), not a per-contract snapshot. Use `get_option_snapshots(symbols = "<OCC-SYMBOL>")` for a single contract. The method is left in place but a docstring note now warns about the mismatch.

## INTERNAL

* `validate_order_params()` updated to accept `legs` / `advanced_instructions` and to allow `order_class = "mleg"` (which also makes `symbol` and `side` optional, since the legs carry that info).

## ENUM ADDITIONS

* `AlpacaAccount$get_portfolio_history()` `intraday_reporting` now lists `"continuous"` as a valid value (for 24/7 crypto charts). `pnl_reset` is documented with its `"per_day"` (default) / `"no_reset"` values. Both are now client-side enum-validated.
* Selected new enum params are validated client-side and abort with a clear message on a typo: `date_type` on `get_calendar()`, `category` and `direction` on `get_activities()`, `status` / `direction` / `side` on `get_orders()`, `intraday_reporting` / `pnl_reset` on `get_portfolio_history()`. (The `feed` and `adjustment` enums are left permissive because Alpaca expands those upstream from time to time.)

## RUNTIME DEPRECATION WARNINGS

* `AlpacaOptions$get_option_snapshot()` now emits a deprecation warning on call. Its URL (`/v1beta1/options/snapshots/{symbol}`) is the underlying-chain endpoint upstream — not a per-contract snapshot. Prefer `get_option_snapshots(symbols = "<OCC>")` for a single contract.
* `AlpacaMarketData$get_corporate_actions()` now emits a deprecation warning on call. `/v2/corporate_actions/announcements` is still functional but Alpaca has flagged it DEPRECATED in favour of `/v1beta1/corporate-actions`.
* Both warnings are rate-limited (`rlang::warn(..., .frequency = "regularly")`), so a tight loop won't spam stderr.

## TESTING

Live integration tests run against the Alpaca paper-trading API; combined with mocked unit tests this release ships with **>560 PASS / 0 FAIL**. The handful of warnings during the run are benign `data.table::rbindlist` notices for empty list columns and predate this release.

The "57 verified" count above refers to the package's 57 R6 methods (a few share an endpoint upstream, e.g. `get_option_snapshot` and `get_option_chain` both call `/v1beta1/options/snapshots/{symbol}`), not 57 distinct upstream endpoints.
